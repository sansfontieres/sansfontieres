# Hello there

I don’t push a lot of public code here, and I mainly use Github to mirror
repositories I self-host on my [sourcehut
instance](https://dev.sansfontieres.com/~romain).

I’m currently working on **Offu**, a library to work with Unified Font Object
written in Zig, and my studio’s website (written in Zig and Go). I also try to
allocate some time to work on font design, but I’m mainly into pure programming
these days.
